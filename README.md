# LRAH

LOS RATONES Auction House or LRAH for short is a project build in Java based on the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a terminal interface and is meant to simulate an real life auction hosue, allowing users to manage auctions, place bids, and handle various auction items.

## Features
- **User managements** : You need of course to register or login if you want to participate at an auction.
- **Main menu**: THe main menu where you can go everywhere : to your user profile, to the ongoing auctions and to the future auctions
- **Bids** : You have the ability to place a bid for every item you want
- **Logs** : There is a log for the auction house, the monitors when a important change is made (a item placed or an auction ended for example)
- **Saved Data** : All the data is saved in CSV files (it should have been a database but oh well...)
- **Custom Exception** : There are custom exceptions for error handling



## The flow of the project

<summary> :construction_worker: </summary>
The first thing you need to do when starting is of course to create an account. From there you arrive at the main menu where i can check to see an ongoing auction and if there are some items of interest. 
If not you can always see what type of auctions are going to be in the future (maybe you are looking for a nice art auction). 
Anyway, if any items on the ongoing auction are really interesting you can place a bid for them. When the auction ends and you are the highest bidder, congratulations! You are now the new owner of the item. 
Let's say you don't want to bid for an item, but want to put an item up for bidding, you can always register the item for a future auction. 
If you are done bidding, can always check your profile to see your new items.
